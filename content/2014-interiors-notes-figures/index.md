<span class="p">The belgian pavilion at the 14th International Architecture Exhibition of La Biennale di Venezia features an original study of domestic interiors in Belgium, based on a photographic survey made in 2014 throughout the country. Architectural transformations, adjustments and modifications of inhabited spaces have been observed and documented through a systematic protocol. For the catalogue, 250 elements were selected from the wide archive of photographs and information. On each page, image, text and architectural drawings are displayed in a systematic editorial structure. For the Belgian Pavillon at the Biennale’s Giardini, an interpretation of the research findings is presented through a minimalist spatial and architectural intervention. In order to fit this approach, the exhibition’s graphics are made by simply cutting out single pages from the publication.<br></br> Photo credit: Maxime Delvaux
